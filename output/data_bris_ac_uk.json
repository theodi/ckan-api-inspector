National Survey of Teachers in Their First Year of Service, 1966-1967 (SN:66031,66032,66033,67032,67033) This group of surveys serves both as a demographic study of probationary teachers and as a longitudinal study in which characteristics of the teachers at the beginning and at the end of the year were related to each other and to characteristics of the school and of the employing authority. It covers seven main areas: probationary background and training; their distribution; appointment and placement; in-service guidance; probationers in the classroom; in the school community; outside school; and career intentions. Arising from findings of this group of surveys, a further research and development project was undertaken by the University of Bristol to investigate the needs, problems, and advantages associated with the mounting of in-service courses for probationers.

As flying animals, they would benefit from a streamlined geometric shape to reduce aerodynamic drag and increase flight efficiency. However, as echolocating animals, their pinnae generate the acoustic cues necessary for navigation and foraging. Moreover, species emitting sound through their nostrils often feature elaborate noseleaves that help in focussing the emitted echolocation pulses. Both pinnae and noseleaves reduce the streamlined character of a bat's morphology. It is generally assumed that by compromising the streamlined charactered of the geometry, the head morphology generates substantial drag, thereby reducing flight efficiency. In contrast, it has also been suggested that the pinnae of bats generate lift forces counteracting the detrimental effect of the increased drag. However, very little data exist on the aerodynamic properties of bat pinnae and noseleaves. In this work, the aerodynamic forces generated by the heads of seven species of bats, including noseleaved bats, are measured by testing detailed 3D models in a wind tunnel. Models of Myotis daubentonii, Macrophyllum macrophyllum, Micronycteris microtis, Eptesicus fuscus, Rhinolophus formosae, Rhinolophus rouxi  and Phyllostomus discolor are tested. The results confirm that non-streamlined facial morphologies yield considerable drag forces but also generate substantial lift. The net effect is a slight increase in the lift-to-drag ratio. Therefore, there is no evidence of high aerodynamic costs associated with the morphology of bat heads.\n</p>","occurs":1},{"value":"<p>The Cardiff survey was undertaken for geographical/planning research purposes, in particular to create the geographical data base required by two associated research projects at the University of Bristol and UWIST.

The calculations are complicated, partly because a molecule has many interacting components, and partly because of the intrinsic complications of quantum mechanics itself.

The field that produces these approximations, then converts them into usable software tools is molecular electronic structure theory.\n</p>\n<p>It turns out that the most highly cited papers in chemistry describe breakthroughs in molecular electronic structure theory.

To this end, the ethos and development of two ideas institutions were investigated - the think tank Demos and the LSE. The project sought to reconceptualise the general dynamics of societal ideas and the role of contemporary intellectuals by suggesting that ideas are increasingly 'vehicular' in character, that is, flexible, mobile, pragmatic, inclusive, and geared towards producing an image of their intellectual 'mediators' as agenda-setting agents in an increasingly media-orientated public sphere. Together with the project's analysis of two prominent 'vehicular ideas' - 'Third Way' and 'knowledge society' - the case studies suggest that this perspective is at least fruitful and challenging in understanding contemporary forms of 'ideas work'. Another research task was to assess whether think tanks and universities are converging in style and practice, and some evidence for this was found. However, the influence runs in both directions, with think tanks like Demos incorporating several typically academic norms.

This collaborative project involved researchers in Ireland and the UK, and was administered by the National Oceanography Centre (NOC), Southampton. Data are managed by the British Oceanographic Data Centre. Much of the CROZEX data processing is ongoing and a number of datasets have yet to be submitted to BODC. The data described here are those presently held by BODC, with the exception of the Argo floats (these data are not expected by BODC and should be accessible via the Argo website) and the four year-long mooring deployments (data from these will be submitted to BODC in the future).\n</p>","occurs":1},{"value":"<p>Novel methods were used to repair and retrodeform the skull, resulting in a three-dimensional digital reconstruction that features a longer postorbital region and more strongly hooked anterior lower jaw than previous attempts while supporting the presence of a midline gap between the nasals and median rostrals.\n</p>","occurs":1},{"value":"<p>X-ray tomographic slice data of early vertebrate tooth plates and scales.\n</p>","occurs":1},{"value":"<p>The 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) began in 1970 when data   were collected about the births and families of babies born in the   United Kingdom in one particular week in 1970.

It covers seven main areas: probationary background and training; their distribution; appointment and placement; in-service guidance; probationers in the classroom; in the school community; outside school; and career intentions. Arising from findings of this group of surveys, a further research and development project was undertaken by the University of Bristol to investigate the needs, problems, and advantages associated with the mounting of in-service courses for probationers.

Evidence from coastal locations raised the intriguing possibility that Mesolithic fishing practices were abruptly replaced by terrestrial resources shortly thereafter.

Claims that the region lacks a clear identity of its own, that it is in fact a series of economic sub-regions and that London, although governed separately, is the cultural and economic core of the South East, are easy to make and to substantiate. This research project moved beyond these preliminary analyses of the 'problem region' of English Devolution. It focused on the process through which the region is constructed as a network of institutions. It considered the emergent relationship between the three institutions of regional government, the Regional Development Association (RDA), the Government Office and the Regional Assembly, to be critical in the formation and operation of the region. This triad of regional institutions has had an immediate and significant impact on local and county government in the South East. However, the effectiveness of their promotion of the South East's interests on the inter-regional and national scale is more questionable. The research found that institutions of regional government in all parts of England are concerned primarily with physical regeneration and economic development initiatives. However, the policy imperatives for South East England are to address the problems of economic success such as transport congestion, labour shortages and a lack of affordable housing. As such, the regional government of the UK's core economic area is failing to address the fundamental requirements of the regional economy. Institutional links between the South East region and London remain under-developed and as such inter-regional policy on important common issues such as housing and transport are fragmented. There is much scope for London government to develop common strategies with their counterparts in the South East and the East of England, although as yet they have achieved relatively little in this respect. This qualitative data collection comprises six transcriptions from interviews with key informants from county councils and regional government organisations in South East England.\n</p>","occurs":1},{"value":"<p>Working memory is a system for holding in mind information in the face of potentially distracting activity, and is often assessed using tasks in which participants maintain memory items while carrying out interleaved ?processing? activity. Performance on such tasks correlates well with measures of academic achievement in children and adults, and does so more strongly than performance on tasks that involve the storage of information without interleaved processing. Consequently, the addition of a processing aspect to a working memory task is important in determining its predictability of academic abilities, but what is less clear is why the addition of processing has this effect. The main aim of this project is to answer this question.\n</p>","occurs":1},{"value":"<p>This project focuses on spoken language production in healthy adult speakers and addresses whether semantic codes involved in speaking are ?static? (ie fixed and independent of any particular context) or ?dynamic? (ie adjusting to circumstances). The latter possibility has been suggested by recent research in language comprehension, but is at present largely unexplored in spoken production. Current accounts of speaking assume that a so-called ?message? in a speaker?s mind serves as relatively ?static? input to the mental lexicon, allowing access to lexical concepts which comprise information about meaning relevant to the ultimate goal of speaking. The alternative ?dynamic? view proposes that the nature and degree of conceptual access varies according to task and situation. The project will test this possibility in a range of tasks commonly used in research on spoken language production (picture-word interference, picture naming with preceding primes, or in conjunction with a secondary task etc). These studies constitute an initial step in characterising the nature of conceptual codes in speaking. If the experiments show that semantic retrieval is focus- and context-dependent, similar studies could be used in other populations such as children or elderly persons, which might advance an understanding of how the semantic system develops across the lifespan.\n</p>","occurs":1},{"value":"<p>This directory contains the figures and corresponding tabulated data files for the manuscript body and Supporting Information.

The ‘Festival of rice packets covering the earth’ and the ‘Festival of rice drawn by lots’ are part of the annual ritual cycle of Lao Buddhists and are performed in the 9th lunar month at new moon and full moon respectively. Both rituals are occasions for caring for deceased relatives, ghosts and agricultural divinities by transferring food and merit to them.

As flying animals, they would benefit from a streamlined geometric shape to reduce aerodynamic drag and increase flight efficiency. However, as echolocating animals, their pinnae generate the acoustic cues necessary for navigation and foraging. Moreover, species emitting sound through their nostrils often feature elaborate noseleaves that help in focussing the emitted echolocation pulses. Both pinnae and noseleaves reduce the streamlined character of a bat's morphology. It is generally assumed that by compromising the streamlined charactered of the geometry, the head morphology generates substantial drag, thereby reducing flight efficiency. In contrast, it has also been suggested that the pinnae of bats generate lift forces counteracting the detrimental effect of the increased drag. However, very little data exist on the aerodynamic properties of bat pinnae and noseleaves. In this work, the aerodynamic forces generated by the heads of seven species of bats, including noseleaved bats, are measured by testing detailed 3D models in a wind tunnel. Models of Myotis daubentonii, Macrophyllum macrophyllum, Micronycteris microtis, Eptesicus fuscus, Rhinolophus formosae, Rhinolophus rouxi  and Phyllostomus discolor are tested. The results confirm that non-streamlined facial morphologies yield considerable drag forces but also generate substantial lift. The net effect is a slight increase in the lift-to-drag ratio. Therefore, there is no evidence of high aerodynamic costs associated with the morphology of bat heads.","occurs":1},{"value":"The Cardiff survey was undertaken for geographical/planning research purposes, in particular to create the geographical data base required by two associated research projects at the University of Bristol and UWIST.

The calculations are complicated, partly because a molecule has many interacting components, and partly because of the intrinsic complications of quantum mechanics itself. Exact quantum mechanical results can be obtained for the simplest of systems, but for real problems, approximations are needed. The field that produces these approximations, then converts them into usable software tools is molecular electronic structure theory.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that the most highly cited papers in chemistry describe breakthroughs in molecular electronic structure theory. The reason is that these methods can be applied universally: they can inform us about the structure and reactivity of any molecule, so they are used by an enormous range of chemists.\r\n\r\nCurrently two approximations dominate the field, density functional theory (DFT) and coupled cluster theory (CC). The first is very efficient (ie runs quickly on computers) and the second is amazingly accurate for many problems. There has been a great deal of progress in making DFT more accurate, and CC theory more efficient; our group has been involved in some of these efforts.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal we set out a new branch of molecular electronic structure theory, based on the concept of treating the electrons one pair at a time, but with each pair embedded in a model provided by the rest of the molecule. These methods could be revolutionary, because their cost appears not much greater than that of DFT, but their accuracy could be competitive with CC theory. \r\n\r\nNow is the right time for this research partly because of the demand for better theoretical methods; and partly because recent breakthroughs in quantum embedding theory give a remarkable opportunity to build new and potentially amazing electronic structure methods.\r\n","occurs":8},{"value":"We identified over 10,000 undescribed S. salar sequences, and designed an analytic workflow to distinguish between paralogs originating from local duplication events or from whole genome duplication events.

To this end, the ethos and development of two ideas institutions were investigated - the think tank Demos and the LSE. The project sought to reconceptualise the general dynamics of societal ideas and the role of contemporary intellectuals by suggesting that ideas are increasingly 'vehicular' in character, that is, flexible, mobile, pragmatic, inclusive, and geared towards producing an image of their intellectual 'mediators' as agenda-setting agents in an increasingly media-orientated public sphere. Together with the project's analysis of two prominent 'vehicular ideas' - 'Third Way' and 'knowledge society' - the case studies suggest that this perspective is at least fruitful and challenging in understanding contemporary forms of 'ideas work'.

Claims that the region lacks a clear identity of its own, that it is in fact a series of economic sub-regions and that London, although governed separately, is the cultural and economic core of the South East, are easy to make and to substantiate. This research project moved beyond these preliminary analyses of the 'problem region' of English Devolution. It focused on the process through which the region is constructed as a network of institutions. It considered the emergent relationship between the three institutions of regional government, the Regional Development Association (RDA), the Government Office and the Regional Assembly, to be critical in the formation and operation of the region. This triad of regional institutions has had an immediate and significant impact on local and county government in the South East. However, the effectiveness of their promotion of the South East's interests on the inter-regional and national scale is more questionable. The research found that institutions of regional government in all parts of England are concerned primarily with physical regeneration and economic development initiatives. However, the policy imperatives for South East England are to address the problems of economic success such as transport congestion, labour shortages and a lack of affordable housing. As such, the regional government of the UK's core economic area is failing to address the fundamental requirements of the regional economy. Institutional links between the South East region and London remain under-developed and as such inter-regional policy on important common issues such as housing and transport are fragmented. There is much scope for London government to develop common strategies with their counterparts in the South East and the East of England, although as yet they have achieved relatively little in this respect.

(ie fixed and independent of any particular context) or ?dynamic? (ie adjusting to circumstances). The latter possibility has been suggested by recent research in language comprehension, but is at present largely unexplored in spoken production. Current accounts of speaking assume that a so-called ?message? in a speaker?s mind serves as relatively ?static? input to the mental lexicon, allowing access to lexical concepts which comprise information about meaning relevant to the ultimate goal of speaking. The alternative ?dynamic? view proposes that the nature and degree of conceptual access varies according to task and situation. The project will test this possibility in a range of tasks commonly used in research on spoken language production (picture-word interference, picture naming with preceding primes, or in conjunction with a secondary task etc). These studies constitute an initial step in characterising the nature of conceptual codes in speaking.
