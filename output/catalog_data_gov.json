The earliest data dates vary considerably by state and region: Maine, Pennsylvania, and Texas have data since 1900.

The survey covers substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and includes questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, perceptions of risks, and needle-sharing.

These services are offered subject to your acceptance of the terms and conditions contained herein as well as any relevant sections of the City of Philadelphia’s Website Policies and Privacy Policy (collectively, the 'Agreements').\r\n\r\nScope\r\n\r\nAll of the content, documentation, code and related materials made available to users of a City managed API are subject to these terms. Access to or use of an API or its content constitutes acceptance to this Agreement.\r\n\r\nUse\r\n\r\nYou may use a City managed API to develop an application or service to search, display, analyze, retrieve, view and otherwise display City data.\r\n\r\nAttribution\r\n\r\nAll services which utilize or access a City managed API should display the following notice prominently within the application: \"This product uses a City of Philadelphia Data API but is not endorsed or certified by the City of Philadelphia\". You may use the City of Philadelphia name or an approved City logo in order to identify the source of API content subject to these rules. You may not use the City name, logo, or the like to imply endorsement of any product, service, or entity, not-for-profit, commercial or otherwise.\r\n\r\nModification or False Representation of Content\r\n\r\nYou may not modify or falsely represent content accessed through a City managed API and still claim the source is the City of Philadelphia. Such practice will result in the termination of access to the City managed APIs.\r\n\r\nRight to Limit\r\n\r\nYour use of the API may be subject to certain limitations on access, calls, or use as set forth within this Agreement or otherwise provided by the City. If the City reasonably believes that you have attempted to exceed or circumvent reasonable usage limits, your ability to use the API may be permanently or temporarily blocked. The City may monitor your use of its APIs to improve the service or to insure compliance with this Agreement.\r\n\r\nService Termination\r\n\r\nIf you wish to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by refraining from further use of a City managed API. The City reserves the right (though not the obligation) to (1) refuse to provide access to an API to you, if it is the City's opinion that use violates any City policy, or (2) terminate or deny you access to and use of all or part of an API at any time for any other reason in its sole discretion. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination including, without limitation, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.\r\n\r\nChanges\r\n\r\nThe City reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement, in whole or in part. Your continued use of or access to a City managed API following posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those modified terms. The City may, in the future, offer new services and/or features through one of its API.

What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there, or learn just by trying to get there, that will make life better here on Earth?\r\n\r\nNASA conducts its work in four principal organizations, called mission directorates:\r\n \r\nAeronautics: works to solve the challenges that still exist in our nation's air transportation system: air traffic congestion, safety and environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nHuman Exploration and Operations: focuses on International Space Station operations, development of commercial spaceflight opportunities and human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\r\n\r\nScience: explores the Earth, solar system and universe beyond; charts the best route of discovery; and reaps the benefits of Earth and space exploration for society.\r\n\r\nSpace Technology: rapidly develops, demonstrates, and infuses revolutionary, high-payoff technologies, expanding the boundaries of the aerospace enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early 21st century, NASA's reach spans the universe. The Mars rover Curiosity is still exploring Mars to see if it might once have had environments suitable for life. Cassini is in orbit around Saturn, as Juno makes its way to Jupiter. The restored Hubble Space Telescope continues to explore the deepest reaches of the cosmos as NASA developes the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the latest crew of the International Space Station is extending the permanent human presence in space. With commercial partners such as SpaceX, NASA is helping to foster the development of private-sector aerospace.\r\n\r\nEarth science satellites are sending back unprecedented data on Earth's oceans, climate and other features.
