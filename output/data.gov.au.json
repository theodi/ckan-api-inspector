These categorisations were made on the basis of data supplied by the City of Greater Geelong and VicMap Planning Zones 2013. Land use mix was calculated using an entropy formula. The resulting land use mix measure is a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates homogenous land use (i.e. the entire suburb is the same land use) and 1 indicates heterogeneous land use (i.e. there are equal areas of each of the different types of land use of interest). \r\n\r\nDistances to sites were calculated along street centrelines. Site information was supplied by the City of Greater Geelong.\r\n\r\nNote that densities are often not spatial densities (eg. number per hectare) but, rather, represent number of sites per population measure or per kilometre of roads.","occurs":1},{"value":"These datasets are supplied by carriers and provide information about the new developments they have contracted to service, including geo-spatial information about the location and boundaries of the development.
